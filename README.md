# Kramerica Golf GPS Web App
A simple and straightforward golf gps web app built on python flask and javascript for your everyday amateur golfer and developer.

Why not use something way more simpler?
- Fast
- Accurate
- FREE
- Doesn't drain your battery
- No app installation or email registration
- No annoying ads, banners or pop ups
- Don't pay for one of those golf GPS apps that are awful to begin with
- Don't buy an expensive range finder
- Device Location and data is not tracked or sent across the internet
- Just get the number of yards to the center of the green and keep it simple
- The app also works in airplane mode since some courses dont always have decent mobile network coverage, just load the web page before you hit the course
